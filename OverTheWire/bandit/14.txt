The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
